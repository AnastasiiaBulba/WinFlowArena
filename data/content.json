      "fullContent": "Creating the pixelated art for Duck Duck involves a meticulous process that combines retro aesthetics with modern design principles. Our art team starts with concept sketches and mood boards to establish the visual style and atmosphere of each level. We then create detailed pixel art using specialized tools that allow for precise control over every pixel. Each level goes through multiple iterations where we test visual clarity, color contrast, and overall aesthetic appeal. The forest levels took over three months to perfect, with countless adjustments to pixel placement, color palettes, and atmospheric effects. We also work closely with our animation team to ensure that all pixelated elements move smoothly and maintain their charm during gameplay.",
